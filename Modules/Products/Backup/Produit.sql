This year the shape of the top deck was redesigned to include the CAMEL DECK. This feature allows an increase in volume along the center line of the board while keeping the heel low to optimize control. For the same outline it is impressive to see how much more flotation and stability is added to the surfboard.&lt;br /&gt;
The New 6&acirc;Äô0 is designed with the new &acirc;ÄúCompact Shapes&acirc;Äù outline that offer the best stability / maneuverability rati . The two boards in the SIGNATURE line up have a very similar feel and F-ONE opted for a square tail on both models. The advantages of the square tail over the swallow give the rider the possibility to get into the curve with more ease and the ability to put more weight on the tail to drive it through turns.&lt;br /&gt;
The rails were made a bit thicker and rounder towards the nose therefore increasing stability to be more forgiving and allow the rider to put more weigh forwards. Compact, Stable, responsive, and well balanced any rider will feel the craftsman&acirc;Äôs ship that went into these boards regardless of the wind and wave conditions. They can adapt to any conditions, they are able to carve long lines or short quick turns without any major adjustments. The rider can focus on the wave knowing that the board will perform. The board will go wherever you take it and will never hold you back.&lt;br /&gt;
While riding strapless they complement well the Mitu Monteiro Line because of their narrower shape and will adapt very well to the high winds and choppy waves that are often found in Europe. The front pad is longer to give riders the possibility to have a wider stance. They are also both equipped with the CAMEL DECK and side grooves to grab the rails.&lt;br /&gt;
Both SIGNATURE boards are setup in a quatro fin setup to make them responsive and have a solid grip on the wave when carving.&lt;br /&gt;
The 6&acirc;Äô0 will be more forgiving than the 5&acirc;Äô10 that is made to be ridden more aggressively and hit the lip hard, while giving you more mobility with a shorter board.&lt;br /&gt;","","6&acirc;Äô0&acirc;Äô&acirc;Äô 182 x 46 cm&lt;br /&gt;

He possesses a great understanding of wave kitesurfing and Surfing. He was completely involved in designing his own board line, while staying in tuned with F-Ones philosophy that boards should be high performance but also versatile.&lt;br /&gt;
Mitu has always favored longer boards but the new compact outline with its round nose allows the board to be more compact while maintaining the stability of a longer one. While throwing freestyle tricks with a surf board, a shorter wider design with a little more floatation makes executing and landing tricks easier. This is why the boards are a little wider to give the rider a compact board that is shorter and more responsive, stable and accessible.&lt;br /&gt;
The hull is shaped with a deep single concave all the way to the fins, this guarantees early planning and a smooth acceleration for freeriding or in surf. The concave also absorbs the chop while riding.&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of work went into developing the New Camel deck : It lowers and stabilizes the heel of the surfer and lock its arch on a rounded center line. It improves stability, maneuverability and increases the rider&acirc;Äôs board control in any conditions.&lt;br /&gt;
Mitu&acirc;Äôs board line is innovative and unique in the sense that it was designed for strapless kitesurfing from the nose to the tail. Mitu rides the same board on flat water, small onshore waves, extreme offshore conditions and just free surfing. He does it all on the same board on the challenging spots of his home island in cabo Verde at a level we can all only dream of.

the latest fine-tuned jewel from the F-ONE R &amp;D team.

CNC-MILLING

The heart of the MONOLITH bar is made directly from a 6061 aluminum block.
The computer numerical control (CNC) fabrication used allows to carve the bar in one unique piece. This new fabrication method is used in conjunction with 6061 Aluminum, an alloy charged with magnesium and Silicium. This material is extremely resistant and is used in the Air and Space fields. On top of its strength, this material offers excellent resilience and great resistance to corrosion.

ANTI-CORROSION

The new MONOLITH bar beneficiaries from a new anodizing process that reinforces the external structure of the bar and blocks all corrosion.

COMFORT

For increased safety and comfort, the bar ends are molded with a soft material.
The anti-sliding thermoformed grip also has a double EVA layer on top of the bar. 

SAFETY SYSTEM

The general safety system has been kept the same: UPS with Velcro quick release. The big advantage is its sand-proof nature. We regularly improve our safety system, this year the chicken loop is equipped with a new injected &Acirc;&laquo;finger&Acirc;&raquo;, stiffer, easier to rotate and adjustable in length.

DEPOWER SYSTEM

The Clamcleat&Acirc;&reg; equipped with its molded handle and with its Neoprene cover remains unchanged.

TECHNOLOGY

The fin base goes through the board and is secured on top by a thin box. The main innovation of this system is that the box does not need to be integrated into the board; rather the board is sandwiched between the fin RESPONSE and its box.
As a result, our 3mm board thickness and its flex are left untouched. With the UNIBOX system and its asymmetric profile, you gain in gliding efficiency and can start planning earlier. It improves the ride comfort as well thanks to the fins flex.

MOUNTING

The fins RESPONSE are color coded on their base (red and green) to facilitate their assembly and respect the asymmetrical aspect. The matching color is also present inside the fin holes on the board. As a result, mounting the fins is really easy: red on red, green on green. The box part on top of the board can be mounted in either direction.

NEW FOR 2013

A notch has been added on the box so you can mount a leash board if you need to.","","","","1","6","_UNIBOX","","","","")

Once the kite is sitting with the leading edge flat on the water, its C-shape associated with the Delta Pivot allows the kite to automatically roll over onto one wing tip. The kite will then glide towards the edge of the window, ready for quick and easy water re-launch.&lt;br /&gt;

The EVO is a V shaped bridle featuring a pulley on each front line, this system offers complete safety and allows for increased de-power by finely tuning the angle of attack of the kite.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the quick release is activated the EVO system becomes the Life Line and the kite lands safely on its back with immediate and total power kill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVO offers complete control with direct and responsive steering in all riding conditions. Sheeting in and out is very progressive, the rider truly directs the kite even when fully de-powered. Unhooked the kite remains light and very predictable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The kite has only 4 lines and a 4m long Life Line!&lt;br /&gt;","For 2013 F-ONE presents the Bandit&acirc;Äôs little brother. A kite built and designed 100% for FREERIDE. The goal was to offer riders of all levels a kite with an intuitive feel, optimum relaunch, great stability and complete power control.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The TRUST gives the rider amazing control of his speed, therefore providing a very smooth ride. Its main attribute being giving the rider easier control in his edging, it is living proof that a kite can also help significantly in absorbing chop and waves. Combined with its great upwind ability and exceptional stability in neutral positions, you will have complete confidence in the TRUST!!&lt;br /&gt;
The kite is very predictable making the steering instinctive and very intuitive. With its direct steering, you will always know where the kite is in the sky &acirc;Äì just as if it was part of your own body. The first time you fly the TRUST you will immediately be able to take advantage of the kites full potential.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stability was at the core of its development and you know you will be in complete control of the TRUST regardless of the wind or wave conditions. Maneuverable and responsive this kite will very quickly give you the confidence to try some new moves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The DELTA C Shape originally designed by F-ONE remains the most progressive design in recent years to optimize relaunch. The leading-edge diameter tapers towards the wingtips, allowing the kite to pivot on its wingtips. This new flexible design allows the kite to quickly relaunch when it is on its back. This auto-relaunch feature gives the rider complete peace of mind when riding or trying new tricks as he knows the kite will always relaunch. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The TRUST was designed to give the rider consistent power and depower with smooth transitions without any twitching or jerking in the bar. With its great depower ability you can bring the power all the way down to zero, making you feel very secure in any conditions. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can also easily neutralize your kite by activating the quick release, which will make the kite land depowered, on its back. The TRUST is equipped with the same quick-release technology as the BANDIT that has been used for years by thousands of kiters who trust its effectivity. &lt;br /&gt;
The bar of the TRUST kite also benefits from the advanced technology applied to the BANDIT MONOLITH BAR and is similarly carved from a single block of aluminum 6061. This CNC tooling process enables us to manufacture the bar from single piece of aluminum. This new technique is combined with the use of aluminum 6061, a composite aluminum made with magnesium and silica used in the aerospace industry. Apart from its increased strength this alloy offers very good stiffness and excellent corrosion resistance.&lt;br /&gt;

Their morphology being different from that of adults, they deserve a specific board. With that in mind and after conducting tests with riders from 12 to 13 years old, we have picked a board of 128 cm long and 36 cm wide as the best possible size suitable for youngsters between 35 to 50 kg (75 to 110 lbs).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Size is not the only specific characteristic: the scoop and general outline has been optimized for their physical strength; the ease of going upwind builds confidence during the first sessions. The flex has been adjusted&lt;br /&gt;
too to produce a lighter board. The star rider of tomorrow can progress quickly by taking advantage of our experience in building the best boards.&lt;br /&gt;","","127x37","Pads Pro Platinium&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
CNC CARVED&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This CNC tooling process enables us to manufacture the bar from single piece of aluminum. This new technique is combined with the use of aluminum 6061, a composite aluminum made with magnesium and silica used in the aerospace industry. Apart from its increased strength this alloy offers very good stiffness and excellent corrosion resistance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
DEPOWER SYSTEM&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The F-ONE depower system is ultra intuitive, resulting in great efficiency and reliability. We are using a rope cleat from Clamcleat&Acirc;&reg;, the reference in the world of sailing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
COMFORT&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For increased safety and comfort, the anti-sliding thermoformed grip also has a double EVA layer on top of the bar. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ANTI-CORROSION&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The new MONOLITH FREERIDE bar benefits from a new anodizing process that reinforces the external structure of the bar and blocks all corrosion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SAFETY SYSTEM&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The general safety system has been kept the same: UPS with Velcro quick release. The big advantage is its sand-proof nature.&lt;br /&gt;
